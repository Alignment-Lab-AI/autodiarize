1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,576
Speaker 1: I've been in a few fights in my day.

2
00:00:04,596 --> 00:00:06,998
Speaker 1: About two hundo, maybe two fitty.

3
00:00:07,699 --> 00:00:08,319
Speaker 1: Yeah!

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,783
Speaker 1: You're dead, Becky!

5
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:21,991
Speaker 1: Where did the time go?

6
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:24,512
Speaker 1: Roger, just have a look around.

7
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:27,894
Speaker 1: There are plenty of other fish in the sea.

8
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:31,755
Speaker 3: I know you're proud of yourself for coming up with that, but I just want Klaus back.

9
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:35,176
Speaker 1: Well, when you love someone, you have to go after them.

10
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:36,817
Speaker 3: Is that how you got Stan?

11
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:38,538
Speaker 1: Bitch, I look like this.

12
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:40,098
Speaker 1: Homegirl don't chase.

13
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:41,979
Speaker 3: Homegirl gets chased.

14
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:43,929
Speaker 3: Klaus wanted taboo.

15
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:45,090
Speaker 3: And danger.

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,531
Speaker 3: I can give that to him.

17
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:47,712
Speaker 3: I'm gonna make this work!

18
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:49,794
Speaker 1: Homegirl don't even have to work!

19
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:52,776
Speaker 1: Homegirl get that paper all on her own!

20
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:53,837
Speaker 3: Stop that.

21
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:54,337
Speaker 3: You're white.

22
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:55,838
Speaker 1: I'm Homegirl.

23
00:00:56,419 --> 00:00:59,041
Speaker 4: Thanks for letting me go back on my medication, Mrs.

24
00:00:59,281 --> 00:00:59,361
Speaker 4: S.

25
00:01:00,122 --> 00:01:01,623
Speaker 1: Better than the alternative.

26
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,462
Speaker 1: Stan, from now on, I'll be taking all of Steve's spankings on his behalf.

27
00:01:16,682 --> 00:01:16,902
Speaker 1: What?

28
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:17,503
Speaker 1: Why?

29
00:01:17,843 --> 00:01:21,486
Speaker 1: Because his mistakes are a reflection on my parenting.

30
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:24,027
Speaker 1: When Steve fails, I fail.

31
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:27,430
Speaker 0: I don't know if that sounds... And he kept calling fouls like a bitch!

32
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,332
Speaker 0: Oh, well, I am gonna punish you on his behalf for that.

33
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:37,229
Speaker 5: Mama, the man said someone died upstairs.

34
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:39,850
Speaker 5: What if I see a g-g-ghost?

35
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,591
Speaker 0: I don't know, Steve.

36
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:44,393
Speaker 1: You'll probably p-p-p-p-p-pitch your pants.

37
00:01:44,913 --> 00:01:45,634
Speaker 1: Where am I?

38
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:47,615
Speaker 1: A hotel room.

39
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:50,877
Speaker 1: You're getting a lot better at drinking, Francine.

40
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:54,158
Speaker 2: Francine, I think I figured out why your catchphrase fell flat.

41
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:56,180
Speaker 1: Because it was a stupid idea.

42
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,241
Speaker 2: No, the words are right, just not the delivery.

43
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:02,083
Speaker 2: Try saying it like you've just been on a road trip through the South.

44
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:06,786
Speaker 1: Things are getting too spicy for the pepper!

45
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:11,989
Speaker 2: Now more like you just came in from playing in the snow, but you haven't had your hot chocolate yet.

46
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,031
Speaker 2: Things are getting too spicy for the pepper!

47
00:02:15,312 --> 00:02:23,657
Speaker 2: Maybe more a mix of sadness that your dog died, relief because he was riddled with fatty lymphomas, and joy that you can now get a new kitty!

48
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:27,800
Speaker 1: Things are getting too spicy for the pepper!

49
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,942
Speaker 2: Watch Oscar-nominated actress Gabourey Sidibe do it.

50
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:33,364
Speaker 3: Things are getting too spicy for the pepper.

51
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:37,359
Speaker 0: Francine, are you sure about this?

52
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:41,381
Speaker 1: Look, the sooner we kill this guy, the sooner we can start enjoying ourselves.

53
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,644
Speaker 1: Oh, I signed us up for hot air ballooning at sunset?

54
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:46,205
Speaker 0: Think we'll nail this guy by then?

55
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:47,746
Speaker 0: I-I'm not sure.

56
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,060
Speaker 1: Come on, what's so hard about it?

57
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:51,541
Speaker 1: Bam, bam, bam!

58
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:54,624
Speaker 1: I just killed that waiter, a baby, and a fat guy on a rascal.

59
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:56,966
Speaker 0: But honey, Joe is the outdoor activities director.

60
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:58,407
Speaker 0: He's always surrounded by people.

61
00:02:58,747 --> 00:02:59,568
Speaker 0: So kill them all!

62
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:02,970
Speaker 0: I think it's hot when you talk like that, but that's not how we do things at the CIA.

63
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,972
Speaker 0: Look, I just need you to get him alone, then I can shoot him.

64
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:10,576
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you figure it out while I take out these two.

65
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:15,146
Speaker 1: Should have done that a long time ago.

66
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:16,746
Speaker 2: About time.

67
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:18,046
Speaker 0: It's 4 o'clock.

68
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:20,187
Speaker 3: Where are my 4 o'clock nachos?

69
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,728
Speaker 1: I got this one.

70
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:25,949
Speaker 1: Steven Smith, I am your mother!

71
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:34,111
Speaker 1: If you don't get out of that cage, I will push you back up my clown hole and birth you again and name you my bitch!

72
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:35,792
Speaker 1: Now get out of that cage!

73
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:39,825
Speaker 1: Let me out of here!

74
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:42,366
Speaker 1: I'll let you out when Steve's a national champion.

75
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:44,406
Speaker 1: Here's a Nintendo to keep you busy.

76
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:48,107
Speaker 1: My mother says video games are bad for you.

77
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:52,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, so is smoking an eight ball of crack in 30 minutes, but that's how long it takes.

78
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:54,389
Speaker 1: What's up, Mountain Douche?

79
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:55,949
Speaker 1: Want a pound of cold one?

80
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:56,909
Speaker 0: Um, what?

81
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,830
Speaker 0: I was thinking we were going to have dinner.

82
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,590
Speaker 0: Why is there a ping pong table in here?

83
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,091
Speaker 1: Uh, so we can play beer pong?

84
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:04,651
Speaker 0: I don't understand what's going on here.

85
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,172
Speaker 0: What's going on here is shots!

86
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:07,752
Speaker 0: Shots!

87
00:04:17,194 --> 00:04:19,957
Speaker 0: So what time is dinner gonna be?

88
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,880
Speaker 1: Six.

89
00:04:23,922 --> 00:04:26,224
Speaker 0: Nemo turned Steve into an apostate of Satan!

90
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:27,866
Speaker 1: He's probably just hungry.

91
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,851
Speaker 1: Steve, I just did a big Trader Joe's run.

92
00:04:31,191 --> 00:04:36,473
Speaker 1: Pour yourself some unsweetened cherry juice, maybe have it with some sunflower paste on a flax crisp.

93
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:42,796
Speaker 1: There's also a scallop shumai that tastes like nothing and a mushroom flatbread pizza that smells like nut sack.
